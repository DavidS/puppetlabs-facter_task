## Description

This module provides the facter_task task. This task allows you to discover facts about remote machines in your infrastructure.

## Requirements
This module is compatible with Puppet Enterprise and Puppet Bolt.

* To run tasks with Puppet Enterprise, PE 2017.3 or later must be installed on the machine from which you are running task commands. Machines receiving task requests must be Puppet agents.

* To run tasks with Puppet Bolt, Bolt 0.5 or later must be installed on the machine from which you are running task commands. Machines receiving task requests must have SSH or WinRM services enabled.

## Usage

To run a facter_task task, use the task command, specifying the fact you want to retrieve.

* With PE on the command line, run `puppet task run facter_task fact=<FACT>`.
* With Bolt on the command line, run `bolt task run facter_task fact=<FACT>`.

For example, to check the operating system family on a machine, run:

* With PE, run `puppet task run facter_task fact=osfamily --nodes neptune`
* With Bolt, run `bolt task run facter_task fact=osfamily --nodes neptune --modulepath ~/modules`

You can also run tasks in the PE console. See PE task documentation for complete information.
